<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>
    Gnocchi (pronounced NYOW-kee) are an Italian pasta, the most common of which is classic potato gnocchi (Gnocchi di patate). 
    They are made of cooked mashed potatoes, flour and eggs. 
    Some gnocchi recipes add ricotta to the dough. "Gnocchi" is the plural for "gnoccho," (which you rarely hear, perhaps because who can eat just one?).

    Because of their shape - small squat shells with ripples - gnocchi are especially good for thick sauces 
    but they're also delicious just drizzled generously with brown butter and a little sage, or with a creamy gorgonzola sauce.
